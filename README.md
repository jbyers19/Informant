Informant is python script which monitors online services and sends notifications if an outage is detected.

Features yet to be added:
 - Unit tests
 - Log the data to an InfluxDB database which can be used in conjunction with a Grafana dashboard to easily see visuals of the service's status and performance.
 - Integrate with Slack using webhooks to send notifications when a status changes.
